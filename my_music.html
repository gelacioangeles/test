      <h2>What is Zero?</h2>
      <p>Zero is my artist name. I use it whenever I am working on music. I have been creating and performing music for around 8-9 years now. The type of music I create is in the genre of Deathmetal, but I also do variations of metal or even different genres.</p>

      <h2>My Path Into Creating Music</h2>
      <p>I started playing guitar at a very young age. Over the years, I've also learned other instruments along the way, such as bass, drums, piano, and even vocals.</p>

      <h2>Demo Track</h2>
      <p>(Thumbnails look similar, the left one is a Deathcore type demo, while the right one is more like nu metal.) Hereâ€™s a demo of two of the songs I'm currently working on:</p>

      <h2>Upcoming Projects?</h2>
      <p>I like to keep everything a surprise but I have so much unreleased work, like the demos above. I think I have around 90-100 unreleased songs ready to go and more than 200 demos that I never got around finishing. When I have enough time, I would like for the whole world to hear my music.</p>
