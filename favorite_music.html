      <h2>Why I Love Metal Music</h2>
      <p>I have been listening to metal music my whole life, ever since I was a baby. My sister was the first person to show me this genre of music and ever since it has stuck with me. I listen to it every day and don't ever plan on stopping.</p>

      <h2>How Metal Music Has Affected My Life</h2>
      <p>There are many ways the genre of metal music has affected my life. Two of the biggest influences that impacted my life were James Hetfield from Metallica and Dimebag from Pantera. They are both guitarists, and the way they played the guitar was so good, that it encouraged me to start learning and playing guitar myself. The first song I learned playing on guitar was "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)" by Metallica. If I never got into the metal music genre, I may have never learned how to play guitar.</p>

      <h2>Memorable Concerts</h2>
      <p>One of the most memorable concerts I've ever attended was the Necromanteum tour with Carnifex being the headliner. When I went to that concert, every performance that happened was amazing. The bands that played in that concert, other than Carnifex were The Last Ten Seconds of Life, To The Grave, and Signs of the Swarm. I got into the front row and even met the band members of Carnifex, got stuff like a poster and drumsticks signed by each member, and a picture.</p>

      <h2>Different Genres of Metal I Enjoy</h2>
      <p>Saying I listen to the genre of metal might be too broad. There are various types of metal music out there, each one with its own unique sound. I try to explore each variety of metal music out there and sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not. The whole genre of metal music is like a spectrum if you think about it. I will include some of the varieties I like below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deathcore</li>
        <li>Metalcore</li>
        <li>Thrash Metal</li>
        <li>Alternative Metal</li>
        <li>Nu Metal</li>
